# Food Donation and Redistribution Platform

> **Abstract** : This project is a web-based platform designed to connect food donors, such as restaurants and individuals, with receivers like NGOs, shelters, or people feeding stray animals. Donors can post details about available food, including type, quantity, and pickup location. Receivers register with their purpose and preferences. With the help of Google Maps, it shares donors based on location proximity. The platform aims to reduce food waste, promote ethical distribution, and support community welfare.
